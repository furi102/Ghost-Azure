## High-Level Architecture:

- Use **Azure App Service Plan** with an autoscaling option to deploy and manage the Ghost Blog application in containers. Azure App Service provides scalability, easy deployment, and automated updates.
- Set up an **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** to host the blog's database for content storage. Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a managed service that ensures high availability and scalability.
- Store media and static assets in **Azure Blob Storage**. Blob Storage provides low-cost, scalable storage for the blog's media files.
- Utilize **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)** to distribute static content globally and improve website performance.
- Implement **Azure Front Door** for global load balancing and geographic failover support.
- Use **Azure Monitor** for monitoring the application's performance and setting up alerts for autoscaling.
- Implement **Azure Functions** for serverless functions, such as the ability to delete all posts at once.

## Scalability and Traffic Handling:

- Use **Autoscaling** in Azure App Service to automatically adjust the number of instances based on traffic or other metrics like CPU usage or web requests.
- Implement **Azure Front Door** to load balance and distribute traffic across multiple instances of the Ghost Blog application.
- Utilize **Azure CDN** to cache and serve static content, offloading traffic from the application servers during traffic spikes.
- Use **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**'s scaling capabilities to handle traffic spikes.

## Disaster Recovery and High Availability:

- Deploy the Ghost Blog application and database in multiple Azure regions for geographic redundancy and fault tolerance.
- Set up database **geo-replication** for automatic failover in case of a region failure.
- Use **Azure Backup** to regularly back up the blog's data and configuration for disaster recovery purposes.

## DevOps and Separated Environments:

- Use **Azure DevOps** to manage CI/CD pipelines for the Ghost Blog application.
- Create separate AKS namespaces or clusters for development, testing, and production environments to support the DevOps teams' workflow.

## Operations and Visibility:

- Utilize **Azure Monitor** to collect and analyze logs and metrics for the Ghost Blog application and infrastructure.
- Implement **Azure Application Insights** for detailed performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Use **Azure Log Analytics** for centralized log management and monitoring.

## Security:

- Implement **Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to protect the Ghost Blog from web application attacks.
- Utilize **Azure Security Center** and **Azure Sentinel** for centralized security monitoring and threat detection.
- Set up **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage access to Azure resources.
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data.

# Acceptance Criteria for the Implementation of the Ghost Blog Platform on Microsoft Azure

## Scalability:

- [ ] The Ghost Blog application automatically scales the number of instances in Azure App Service based on traffic. 
- [ ] Azure Database for PostgreSQL can handle increasing loads during traffic spikes without performance degradation.
- [ ] Load balancing and distribution of traffic are smooth during high-traffic periods, and there are no bottlenecks affecting user experience.

## Security:

- [ ] Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) is implemented to protect the Ghost Blog application against common web application vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Sensitive data, such as database credentials and access keys, are securely stored using Azure Key Vault or Azure Managed Identity.
- [ ] Network Security Groups (NSGs) are configured appropriately to control traffic to the application and database, and there are no unauthorized access points.

## Consistent Results:

- [ ] The Ghost Blog application consistently returns the same results for all users across different sessions and interactions.
- [ ] Caching mechanisms, if used, provide consistent content to users without stale data or inconsistencies.

## Resiliency:

- [ ] The Ghost Blog application is deployed across multiple Azure regions to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- [ ] Azure Front Door is configured for geographic failover in case of a significant geographical failure, and failover testing is successful.
- [ ] Azure Database for PostgreSQL has geo-replication enabled, and disaster recovery testing ensures data integrity and recovery.

## Observability:

- [ ] Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights are implemented to monitor the application's performance, health, and logs.
- [ ] Key metrics, such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization, are tracked and visualized in monitoring dashboards for easy observability.
- [ ] Logging captures relevant information for debugging and troubleshooting, and log analysis tools provide valuable insights into application behavior.

## Automation:

- [ ] The deployment of the Ghost Blog application and environment is automated using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines are set up using Azure DevOps or any other suitable CI/CD tools, allowing for seamless and frequent deployments without downtime.

## Disaster Recovery Testing:

- [ ] Disaster recovery plans are documented, and periodic testing ensures data and service recovery in case of any unforeseen incidents. Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) are met.

## Load Testing:

- [ ] The application has undergone load testing, and the results demonstrate that it can handle traffic spikes up to four times the typical load without performance degradation.

## Security Testing:

- [ ] Security assessments, such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, have been conducted to identify and remediate potential security flaws, ensuring a robust security posture.

## Documentation:

- [ ] Detailed documentation is provided for the implemented architecture, including infrastructure setup, security configurations, monitoring, and disaster recovery procedures. The documentation is comprehensive and accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
- [ ] 

# Alternatively Azure Kubernetes service (aks) 

## Scalability
The application can also be deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)  to automatically scale the number of containers based on traffic, as per the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration. 
In this scenario, an Azure Container Repository (acr) can provide an image to deploy an application to aks in multiple Azure regions for geographic redundancy and fault tolerance.
